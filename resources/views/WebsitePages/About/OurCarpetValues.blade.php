            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 md:mb-6">The craft of creating natural dyes is a fascinating and ancient art that is over thousand years old. Prior to the twentieth century, traditional paint-based dyes were produced according to recipes handed down from generation to generation. One of the most important coloring agents was madder, a common plant that grows wild throughout the middle east and provides the basis for different shades of red, pink, blue and purple.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 md:mb-6">designs require fine knotting, though this doesn’t ensure a high quality product. The masterpieces of the fines designs will have both very high knot counts and use the wools and dyes selected by the master weavers. Many superior rugs have modest knot counts but with such excellent colors and wools as to render them solid investment in excellence and of breathtaking beauty.</p>
